# Google-Analytics-FB-Graph-API
I have used google analytics api and fb graph api to retrieve information about ADS Running on Google ADWORDS and FACEBOOK.


CLONE the repository

Put the `Google Analytics` `API` Credentials in `auth.json`

Put the `Parse` `API` Credentials in `parseCredentials.json`

Put the `Facebook` `access_token` in the `access_token` key present in `parseCredentials.json`

`time.js` holds the date format which is used in all the api calls.

`Report.js` is the main file through which the function runs.
